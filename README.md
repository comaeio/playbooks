# Comae Playbooks

Comae playbooks are a set of rules mapped to the [MITRE ATT&CKÂ®](https://attack.mitre.org/) framework. They are designed to provide the ability for blue teamers, incident responders and threat hunters to ask complex questions to a memory snapshot acquired by [Comae DumpIt](https://magnetidealab.com) through our platform.
