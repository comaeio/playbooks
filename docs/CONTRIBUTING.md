## Getting started
We use Github issues to track the following:

* Bug reports, including broken playbooks
* New feature requests
* Requests for updates or changes

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the playbooks, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/comaeio/playbooks/issues/new/choose). 

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/comaeio/playbooks/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.
